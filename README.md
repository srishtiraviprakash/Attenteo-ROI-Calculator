# Attenteo ROI Calculator

This project is a web-based ROI calculator I built for Attenteo, a healthcare SaaS company. The goal was to help clinic operators estimate how much money they could save annually by using Attenteoâ€™s platform.

Users can enter details about their clinic operations (like number of locations, staff, travel, etc.), and the calculator instantly outputs projected savings across categories like compliance, travel, and efficiency.

## Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS (Bootstrap 5)
- JavaScript
- jQuery

## Features

- Dynamic ROI calculations based on user input
- Breakdown of:
  - Compliance manager savings
  - HR savings from program launches
  - Travel savings
  - Operational efficiency gains
  - Supply waste reduction
- Total hard savings (matches client Excel logic)
- Total estimated annual savings

## How to Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No installation or setup needed.
